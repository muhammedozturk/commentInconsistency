 Indicates whether the native implementation should proceed with a pending, native focus request. Before changing the focus at the native level, the AWT implementation should always call this function for permission. This function will reject the request if a duplicate request preceded it, or if the specified heavyweight Component already owns the focus and no native focus changes are pending. Otherwise, the request will be approved and the focus request list will be updated so that, if necessary, the proper descendant will be focused when the corresponding FOCUS_GAINED event on the heavyweight is received. An implementation must ensure that calls to this method and native focus changes are atomic. If this is not guaranteed, then the ordering of the focus request list may be incorrect, leading to errors in the type-ahead mechanism. Typically this is accomplished by only calling this function from the native event pumping thread, or by holding a global, native lock during invocation.

 This method determines which menu items get to be 'action items' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be 'overflow items' in a secondary menu. The rules are as follows: <p>Items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu. There is a limit of mMaxActionItems as a total count, optionally including the overflow menu button itself. This is a soft limit; if an item shares a group ID with an item previously included as an action item, the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit. This is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar. Only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space, and groups are treated as a single concept. <p>There is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space: mActionWidthLimit. This limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space, but no further items may be added. If an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width, the entire group will be demoted to overflow. This is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general UI clutter. <p>The space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items. Once items begin to overflow, all future items become overflow items as well. This is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app's intended design.

 Helper called by generated code to construct default values for string fields. <p> The protocol compiler does not actually contain a UTF-8 decoder -- it just pushes UTF-8-encoded text around without touching it.  The one place where this presents a problem is when generating Java string literals. Unicode characters in the string literal would normally need to be encoded using a Unicode escape sequence, which would require decoding them. To get around this, protoc instead embeds the UTF-8 bytes into the generated code and leaves it to the runtime library to decode them. <p> It gets worse, though.  If protoc just generated a byte array, like: new byte[] {0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78} Java actually generates *code* which allocates an array and then fills in each value.  This is much less efficient than just embedding the bytes directly into the bytecode.  To get around this, we need another work-around.  String literals are embedded directly, so protoc actually generates a string literal corresponding to the bytes.  The easiest way to do this is to use the ISO-8859-1 character set, which corresponds to the first 256 characters of the Unicode range.  Protoc can then use good old CEscape to generate the string. <p> So we have a string literal which represents a set of bytes which represents another string.  This function -- stringDefaultValue -- converts from the generated string to the string we actually want.  The generated code calls this automatically.

 The introduction of IAllocationContexts has added some complexity to the older concept of a free list.  With AllocationContexts it is possibly for allocator to have free space available but this being restricted to a specific AllocationContext. <p> In addition to the standard free allocation search we want to add a "density" restriction for small slots to encourage the aggregation of writes (by increasing the likelihood of sibling slot allocation). <p> There is some "Do What I mean" complexity here, with difficulty in  determining a good rule to identify an initial allocation point.  There is a danger of significantly reducing the allocation efficiency of short transactions if we too naively check committed bit density.  We should only do this when identifying the initial allocation, and when the allocIndex is incremented.

 Returns all the text in the given File.
 We need to let the user decide if he wants to load the singleplayer player from the level.dat file or if he wants to load the multiplayer players. That is, because a singleplayer map will have the playerdata directory. It contains information about each player that ever played on the map. However, if the map is loaded as singleplayer map, minecraft will use the information that is stored in the level.dat file. It will also overwrite the file in the playerdata directory that belongs to the player that loaded the map in singleplayer mode. So, if we change the player location in the playerdata directory it will just be ignored if the map is used as singleplayer map.

 Create a new receiver instance.
 Called by the lookupListener's notify() method. Checks the event sequence number and, based on whether or not a "gap" is found in in the event sequence, creates and places on the queue, either a LookupTask (if a gap was found) or a NotifyTask. Recall that the Event specification states that if the sequence numbers of two successive events differ by only 1, then one can be assured that no events were missed. On the other hand, if the difference is greater than 1 (the sequence contains a "gap"), then one or more events may -- or may not -- have been missed. Thus, if a gap is found in the events, although it's possible that no events were missed, this method takes the conservative approach by assuming events were missed. When this method determines that an event may have been missed, it requests a current "snapshot" of the given ServiceRegistrar's state by queueing the execution of a LookupTask. Since this method can safely assume that no events have been missed if it finds no gaps in the event sequence, this method queues the notification of the entity by requesting the execution of a NotifyEventTask. Note that when a lookup service is discovered, this utility registers with that lookup service's event mechanism for service events related to the services of interest. Upon registering with the event mechanism, a data structure (of type EventReg) containing information about that registration is placed in a Map for later processing when events do arrive. If the timing is right, it is possible that a service event may arrive between the time the registration is made and the time the EventReg is stored in the map. Thus, this method may find that the eventRegMap does not contain an element corresponding to the event this method is currently processing. In that case, this method will do nothing. It will simply return so that the service referenced in the event can be discovered using the snapshot returned by the LookupTask that is ultimately queued by the RegisterListenerTask (whose listener registration caused this method to be invoked in the first place).

 We need to be running this test suite for each of the BufferModes that we want to support. This is because there are subtle interactions between the BufferMode, the AbstractTask, and the execution of mutation operations. One approach might be to pass in a collection of BufferMode values rather than a singleton and then generate the test suite for each BufferMode value in that collection [I've tried this, but I am missing something in the proxy test pattern with the outcome that the tests are not properly distinct.]

 (Try to) trim the pool until its total space falls below the max size (soft cap). This will get rid of values on the free list, until the free lists are empty, or we fall below the max size; whichever comes first. NOTE: It is NOT an error if we have eliminated all the free values, but the pool is still above its max size (soft cap) <p> The approach we take is to go from the smallest sized bucket down to the largest sized bucket. This may seem a bit counter-intuitive, but the rationale is that allocating larger-sized values is more expensive than the smaller-sized ones, so we want to keep them around for a while.
 We only want the current page that is being shown to be focusable.
 Reads a string until the specified delimiter or EOF is encountered
 Add new line of elements at top, to keep layout, have to virtually layout from beginning. Here is an example to explain why: Say total width is 10, current line is [5, 2, 1], 3 numbers before current line is 7, 2, 6. If you just look back, you could say previous line [2, 6], but there is another possibility: [7, 2], [6]. You don't know which one is correct without knowing how the line before previous one, same thing could happen to that line too, so you have to sort everything from beginning or cache the result.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuv#Y.27UV420p_.28and_Y.27V12_or_YV12.29_to_RGB888_conversion for the description of the YUV420p format: "Y'UV420p is a planar format, meaning that the Y', U, and V values are grouped together instead of interspersed. The reason for this is that by grouping the U and V values together, the image becomes much more compressible. When given an array of an image in the Y'UV420p format, all the Y' values come first, followed by all the U values, followed finally by all the V values. As with most Y'UV formats, there are as many Y' values as there are pixels. Where X equals the height multiplied by the width, the first X indices in the array are Y' values that correspond to each individual pixel. However, there are only one fourth as many U and V values. The U and V values correspond to each 2 by 2 block of the image, meaning each U and V entry applies to four pixels. After the Y' values, the next X/4 indices are the U values for each 2 by 2 block, and the next X/4 indices after that are the V values that also apply to each 2 by 2 block. size.total = size.width * size.height; y = yuv[position.y * size.width + position.x]; u = yuv[(position.y / 2) * (size.width / 2) + (position.x / 2) + size.total]; v = yuv[(position.y / 2) * (size.width / 2) + (position.x / 2) + size.total + (size.total / 4)]; rgb = Y'UV444toRGB888(y, u, v); "

 Test the named character encoding to verify that it converts ASCII characters correctly. We have to use an ASCII based encoding, or else the NetworkClients will not work correctly in EBCDIC based systems. However, we cannot just use ASCII or ISO8859_1 universally, because in Asian locales, non-ASCII characters may be embedded in otherwise ASCII based protocols (eg. HTTP). The specifications (RFC2616, 2398) are a little ambiguous in this matter. For instance, RFC2398 [part 2.1] says that the HTTP request URI should be escaped using a defined mechanism, but there is no way to specify in the escaped string what the original character set is. It is not correct to assume that UTF-8 is always used (as in URLs in HTML 4.0).  For this reason, until the specifications are updated to deal with this issue more comprehensively, and more importantly, HTTP servers are known to support these mechanisms, we will maintain the current behavior where it is possible to send non-ASCII characters in their original unescaped form.

 Format method for the d conversion character and long argument. For d format, the flag character '-', means that the output should be left justified within the field.  The default is to pad with blanks on the left.  A '+' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign (+ or -).  The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank.  If both a '+' and a ' ' are specified, the blank flag is ignored.  The '0' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks. The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed.  The default is to add no padding.  Padding is with blanks by default. The precision, if set, is the minimum number of digits to appear.  Padding is with leading 0s.

 This method is the first of two required to facilitate superposition. The underlying representation (i.e. the voting record) is an ArrayList of FixedBitSet, each with dimension "dimension", which can be thought of as an expanding 2D array of bits. Each column keeps count (in binary) for the respective dimension, and columns are incremented in parallel by sweeping a bitset across the rows. In any dimension in which the BitSet to be added contains a "1", the effect will be that 1's are changed to 0's until a new 1 is added (e.g. the column '110' would become '001' and so forth). The first method deals with floating point issues, and accelerates superposition by decomposing the task into segments.

 Once the compressed tables have been computed, this method reads in a template file for the source code to be generated and writes out the final source code by acting as a sort of specialized macro processor. The first output line is a comment saying that the file was automatically generated; it includes a timestamp.  All other output is generated by reading a line from the template file, performing macro replacements, and then writing the resulting line or lines of code to the output file. This method handles the I/O, the timestamp comment, and the locating of macro calls within each input line.  The method replaceCommand is called to generate replacement text for each macro call. Macro calls to be replaced are indicated in the template file by occurrences of the commandMarker "$$".  The rest of the call may consist of Java letters (including the underscore "_") and also of balanced parentheses.

 DOM Level 1 did not have a standard mechanism for creating a new Document object. This function provides a DOM-implementation-independent abstraction for that for that concept. It's typically used when  outputting a new DOM as the result of an operation. <p> TODO: This isn't directly compatable with DOM Level 2.  The Level 2 createDocument call also creates the root  element, and thus requires that you know what that element will be before creating the Document. We should think about whether we want to change this code, and the callers, so we can use the DOM's own  method. (It's also possible that DOM Level 3 may relax this sequence, but you may give up some intelligence in the DOM by doing so; the intent was that knowing the document type and root element might let the DOM automatically switch to a specialized subclass for particular kinds of documents.)

 helper method for parsing Newick tree 
 Adds the specified node to the list of selected nodes. The list of selected nodes is guaranteed to be sorted in the same direction that the nodes appear in the tree. We only allow nodes to be in the selected list that are peers in the tree (we do not allow selects to span multiple depths in the tree. <p/> Behavior: If no modifier key is depressed, the list of selected nodes will be set to contain just the node passed to this method. <p/> Shift select: If shift is depressed, then we attempt to do a continuous range select. If there exists one or more nodes in the selected nodes list, we test if the node falls within the list. If it does not fall within, we connect the contiguous range of nodes from the specified node to the nearest selected node. If the node falls within the list, we do a continuous range selection to the LAST node that was selected, not the closest. <p/> CTRL select: If CTRL is depressed then we simply search for the insertion point of the specified node in the already sorted select list. If the node is already present, then we remove it and unselect the node. If it was not present, then we insert the node at the appropriate spot in the array and select it.

 Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them, while coping with a number of issues: 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread. 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and clearInterruptsForTaskRun called to ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have its interrupt set. 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing the task. 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task, gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute. We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.  Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die. 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task.run throws. The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code.

 Expands the cell union such that it contains all cells of the given level that are adjacent to any cell of the original union. Two cells are defined as adjacent if their boundaries have any points in common, i.e. most cells have 8 adjacent cells (not counting the cell itself). Note that the size of the output is exponential in "level". For example, if level == 20 and the input has a cell at level 10, there will be on the order of 4000 adjacent cells in the output. For most applications the Expand(min_fraction, min_distance) method below is easier to use.

 Creates a string representation of the integer argument as an unsigned integer in base 2. The unsigned integer value is the argument plus 232if the argument is negative; otherwise it is equal to the argument. This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits in binary (base2) with no extra leading 0s. If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('u0030'); otherwise, the first character of the representation of the unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The characters '0' ('u0030') and '1' ('u0031') are used as binary digits.

 Returns a new Double object initialized to the value represented by the specified string. The string s is interpreted as the representation of a floating-point value and a Double object representing that value is created and returned. If s is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. Leading and trailing whitespace characters in s are ignored. The rest of s should constitute a FloatValue as described by the lexical rule: where and are as defined in Section 3.10.2 of the . If it does not have the form of a , then a NumberFormatException is thrown. Otherwise, it is regarded as representing an exact decimal value in the usual "computerized scientific notation"; this exact decimal value is then conceptually converted to an "infinitely precise" binary value that is then rounded to type double by the usual round-to-nearest rule of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic. Finally, a new object of class Double is created to represent the double value.

 This function is used when implementing a naming system that supports junctions.  For example, when the a_bind_nns(name, newobj) method is invoked, that means the caller is attempting to bind the object 'newobj' to the nns of 'name'.  For context that supports junctions, 'name' names a junction and is pointing to the root of another naming system, which in turn might have an nns. This means that a_bind_nns() should first resolve 'name' and attempt to continue the operation in the context named by 'name'.  (i.e. bind to the nns of the context named by 'name'). If name is already empty, then throw NameNotFoundException because this context by default does not have any nns.

 The main method.<p> We split live ranges for registers around PEIs which have catch blocks.  Suppose we have a PEI s which uses a symbolic register r1.  We must ensure that after register allocation, r1 is NOT assigned to a scratch location in s, since this would mess up code in the catch block that uses r1.<p> So, instead, we introduce a new temporary r2 which holds the value of r1.  The live range for r2 spans only the instruction s.  Later, we will ensure that r2 is never spilled.<p> TODO: This could be implemented more efficiently.

 Check validity of using fast-path for this instance. If fast-path is valid for this instance, sets fast-path state as true and initializes fast-path utility fields as needed. This method is supposed to be called rarely, otherwise that will break the fast-path performance. That means avoiding frequent changes of the properties of the instance, since for most properties, each time a change happens, a call to this method is needed at the next format call. FAST-PATH RULES: Similar to the default DecimalFormat instantiation case. More precisely: - HALF_EVEN rounding mode, - isGroupingUsed() is true, - groupingSize of 3, - multiplier is 1, - Decimal separator not mandatory, - No use of exponential notation, - minimumIntegerDigits is exactly 1 and maximumIntegerDigits at least 10 - For number of fractional digits, the exact values found in the default case: Currency : min = max = 2. Decimal  : min = 0. max = 3.

 V&H is a system of coordinates (V and H) for describing locations of rate centers in the United States. The projection, devised by J. K. Donald, is an "elliptical," or "doubly equidistant" projection, scaled down by a factor of 0.003 to balance errors. <P> The foci of the projection, from which distances are measured accurately (except for the scale correction), are at 37d 42m 14.69s N, 82d 39m 15.27s W (in Floyd Co., Ky.) and 41d 02m 55.53s N, 112d 03m 39.35 W (in Webster Co., Utah). They are just 0.4 radians apart. <P> Here is the transformation from latitude and longitude to V&H: First project the earth from its ellipsoidal surface to a sphere. This alters the latitude; the coefficients bi in the program are the coefficients of the polynomial approximation for the inverse transformation. (The function is odd, so the coefficients are for the linear term, the cubic term, and so on.) Also subtract 52 degrees from the longitude. <P> For the rest, compute the arc distances of the given point to the reference points, and transform them to the coordinate system in which the line through the reference points is the X-axis and the origin is the eastern reference point. The solution is <P> h = (square of distance to E - square of distance to W + square of distance between E and W) / twice distance between E and W; <BR> v = square root of absolute value of (square of distance to E - square of h). <P> Reduce by three-tenths of a percent, rotate by 76.597497 degrees, and add 6363.235 to V and 2250.7 to H. <P> To go the other way, as this program does, undo the final translation, rotation, and scaling. The z-value Pz of the point on the x-y-z sphere satisfies the quadratic Azz+Bz+c=0, where <P> A = (ExWz-EzWx)^2 + (EyWzx-EzWy)^2 + (ExWy-EyWx)^2; <BR> B = -2[(Ex cos(arc to W) - Wx cos(arc to E))(ExWz-EzWx) - (Ey cos(arc to W) -Wy cos(arc to E))(EyWz-EzWy)]; <BR> C = (Ex cos(arc to W) - Wx cos(arc to E))^2 + (Ey cos(arc to W) - Wy cos(arc to E))^2 - (ExWy - EyWx)^2. <P> Solve with the quadratic formula. The latitude is simply the arc sine of Pz. Px and Py satisfy <P> ExPx + EyPy + EzPz = cos(arc to E); <BR> WxPx + WyPy + WzPz = cos(arc to W). <P> Substitute Pz's value, and solve linearly to get Px and Py. The longitude is the arc tangent of Px/Py. Finally, this latitude and longitude are spherical; use the inverse polynomial approximation on the latitude to get the ellipsoidal earth latitude, and add 52 degrees to the longitude.

 This method deals with the fact, that the decoding process doesn't always yield a single most likely value. The current error correction implementation doesn't deal with erasures very well, so it's better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure. The problem is that we don't know which of the ambiguous values to choose. We try decode using the first value, and if that fails, we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again. This usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes, so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this.

 Returns node holding key or null if no such, clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way.  Repeatedly traverses at base-level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findPredecessor, processing base-level deletions as encountered. Some callers rely on this side-effect of clearing deleted nodes. Restarts occur, at traversal step centered on node n, if: (1) After reading n's next field, n is no longer assumed predecessor b's current successor, which means that we don't have a consistent 3-node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered. (2) n's value field is null, indicating n is deleted, in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying.  Even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn't require restart, they aren't sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting. (3) n is a marker or n's predecessor's value field is null, indicating (among other possibilities) that findPredecessor returned a deleted node. We can't unlink the node because we don't know its predecessor, so rely on another call to findPredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor, which it will do. This check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop, (and the b.value check isn't strictly needed at all) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links, and so will retry anyway. The traversal loops in doPut, doRemove, and findNear all include the same three kinds of checks. And specialized versions appear in findFirst, and findLast and their variants. They can't easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed.

 * Binomial-Distribution - Acceptance Rejection/Inversion      * * Acceptance Rejection method combined with Inversion for         generating Binomial random numbers with parameters              n (number of trials) and p (probability of success).            For  min(n*p,n*(1-p)) < 10  the Inversion method is applied:    The random numbers are generated via sequential search,         starting at the lowest index k=0. The cumulative probabilities  are avoided by using the technique of chop-down.                For  min(n*p,n*(1-p)) >= 10  Acceptance Rejection is used:      The algorithm is based on a hat-function which is uniform in    the centre region and exponential in the tails.                 A triangular immediate acceptance region in the centre speeds   up the generation of binomial variates.                         If candidate k is near the mode, f(k) is computed recursively   starting at the mode m.                                         The acceptance test by Stirling's formula is modified           according to W. Hoermann (1992): The generation of binomial     random variates, to appear in J. Statist. Comput. Simul.        If  p < .5  the algorithm is applied to parameters n, p.        Otherwise p is replaced by 1-p, and k is replaced by n - k.     * * FUNCTION:    - samples a random number from the binomial        distribution with parameters n and p  and is     valid for  n*min(p,1-p)  >  0.
