 zGetWeekNumberForASevenDayRange, This returns a week number for the specified seven day range, according to the supplied weekFieldRules. If all seven days fall on the same week number, then that week number will be returned. If "requireUnanimousWeekNumber" is true and the supplied range falls across two week numbers, then null is returned. If "requireUnanimousWeekNumber" is false and the supplied range falls across two week numbers, then the "majority rules" system is used for determining the returned week number. The majority rules system means that the most common week number in the seven day range will be returned. For example: If days 1 and 2 are in week 30, and days 3 through 7 are in week 31, then the week number 31 will be returned. There is no possibility of a "tie" week number, because the number of days in the range is seven (an odd number). Additionally, the returned week number will always be the correct week number for a minimum of four days out of the seven day range. To make sure that all seven days in the range -can- fall on the same week number, the caller of the function would need to supply a seven day range that starts on the same "first day of the week" that is used by the supplied weekFieldRules. I don't know if there are any special cases where these matching parameters are supplied, but the result is still not a unanimous week number. The week fields object can be created from a specific locale, (including Locale.ISO if desired), or the week fields can be configured to match any desired week field rules. Examples of creating week field instances: WeekFields weekFields = WeekFields.of(Locale locale); WeekFields weekFields = WeekFields.of(DayOfWeek firstDayOfWeek, int minimalDaysInFirstWeek);

 Attempt to recover from a syntax error.  This returns false if recovery  fails, true if it succeeds.  Recovery happens in 4 steps.  First we pop the parse stack down to a point at which we have a shift out of the top-most state on the error Symbol.  This represents the initial error recovery configuration.  If no such configuration is found, then we fail.  Next a small number of "lookahead" or "parse ahead" Symbols are read into a buffer.  The size of this buffer is  determined by error_sync_size() and determines how many Symbols beyond the error must be matched to consider the recovery a success.  Next,  we begin to discard Symbols in attempt to get past the point of error to a point where we can continue parsing.  After each Symbol, we attempt  to "parse ahead" though the buffered lookahead Symbols.  The "parse ahead" process simulates that actual parse, but does not modify the real  parser's configuration, nor execute any actions. If we can  parse all  the stored Symbols without error, then the recovery is considered a  success.  Once a successful recovery point is determined, we do an actual parse over the stored input -- modifying the real parse  configuration and executing all actions.  Finally, we return the the  normal parser to continue with the overall parse.

 For f format, the flag character '-', means that the output should be left justified within the field.  The default is to pad with blanks on the left.  '+' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign (+ or -).  The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank.  If both a '+' and a ' ' are specified, the blank flag is ignored.  The '0' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks. The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed.  The default is to add no padding.  Padding is with blanks by default. The precision, if set, is the number of digits to appear after the radix character.  Padding is with trailing 0s.

 Grow the pixel buffer if necessary.  Using this method instead of allocating a new buffer every time a frame is grabbed improves performance by reducing the frequency of garbage collections. In a simple test, the unmodified version of IPCameraFrameGrabber caused about 200MB of allocations within 13 seconds.  In this version, almost no additional heap space is typically allocated per frame. The downside to this is that the returned frames can't really be modified, so this probably won't go upstream, but it's useful for us because in GRIP we don't operate on images in-place.

 Returns node holding key or null if no such, clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way.  Repeatedly traverses at base-level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findPredecessor, processing base-level deletions as encountered. Some callers rely on this side-effect of clearing deleted nodes. Restarts occur, at traversal step centered on node n, if: (1) After reading n's next field, n is no longer assumed predecessor b's current successor, which means that we don't have a consistent 3-node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered. (2) n's value field is null, indicating n is deleted, in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying.  Even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn't require restart, they aren't sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting. (3) n is a marker or n's predecessor's value field is null, indicating (among other possibilities) that findPredecessor returned a deleted node. We can't unlink the node because we don't know its predecessor, so rely on another call to findPredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor, which it will do. This check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop, (and the b.value check isn't strictly needed at all) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links, and so will retry anyway. The traversal loops in doPut, doRemove, and findNear all include the same three kinds of checks. And specialized versions appear in findFirst, and findLast and their variants. They can't easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed.

 Method retrieves the PEM encoded data from the stream and returns its decoded representation. Method checks correctness of PEM boundaries. It supposes that the first '-' of the opening boundary has already been read from the stream. So first of all it checks that the leading bytes are equal to "-----BEGIN" boundary prefix. Than if boundary_suffix is not null, it checks that next bytes equal to boundary_suffix + new line char[s] ([CR]LF). If boundary_suffix parameter is null, method supposes free suffix format and skips any bytes until the new line.<br> After the opening boundary has been read and checked, the method read Base64 encoded data until closing PEM boundary is not reached.<br> Than it checks closing boundary - it should start with new line + "-----END" + boundary_suffix. If boundary_suffix is null, any characters are skipped until the new line.<br> After this any trailing new line characters are skipped from the stream, Base64 encoding is decoded and returned.

 Determines if a file is newer than another by comparing the timestamps and sizes. This heuristic is consisten with the behavior of rotating log files: at the instant the file is rotated there will likely exist two files with the same timestamp; in that case, knowing nothing else about the files, the old file is almost certainly the one which has more data, since the newer file has just been created (or truncated) and would not have enough data yet. TODO: The edge case where the new file fills so quickly (within 1 second) to become as large as the old file will escape this heuristic. This is *exceedingly rare* to happen in reality however, and will soon rectify itself (within 1 second) since the timestamp of the file that's being written to will change, and the sizes won't matter anymore.

 Increments the "keep-alive count". The "keep-alive count" is the number of non-permanent remote objects that are either in the object table or still have calls in progress. Therefore, this method should be invoked exactly once for every non-permanent remote object exported (a remote object must be exported before it can have any calls in progress). The VM is "kept alive" while the keep-alive count is greater than zero; this is accomplished by keeping a non-daemon thread running. Because non-permanent objects are those that can be garbage collected while exported, and thus those for which the "reaper" thread operates, the reaper thread also serves as the non-daemon VM keep-alive thread; a new reaper thread is created if necessary.

 Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them, while coping with a number of issues: 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread. 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have its interrupt set. 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing the task. 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task, gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute. We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables. Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die. 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task.run throws. The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code.

 Causes current thread to wait until another thread invokes the method or the method for this object. In other word's this method behaves exactly as if it simply performs the call wait(0). The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up either through a call to the notify method or the notifyAll method. The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution. This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. See the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor.

 Returns a String representation for the specified float value. The argument is converted to a readable string format as follows. All characters and characters in strings mentioned below are ASCII characters. If the argument is NaN, the result is the string "NaN". Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude (absolute value) of the argument. If the sign is negative, the first character of the result is '-' ('-'); if the sign is positive, no sign character appears in the result. As for the magnitude m: If m is infinity, it is represented by the characters "Infinity"; thus, positive infinity produces the result "Infinity" and negative infinity produces the result "-Infinity". If m is zero, it is represented by the characters "0.0"; thus, negative zero produces the result "-0.0" and positive zero produces the result "0.0". If m is greater than or equal to 10-3 but less than 107, then it is represented as the integer part of m, in decimal form with no leading zeroes, followed by '.' (.), followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of m. If m is less than 10-3 or not less than 107, then it is represented in so-called "computerized scientific notation." Let n be the unique integer such that 10n =m 1; then let a be the mathematically exact quotient of m and 10n so that 1 a&lt10. The magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a, as a single decimal digit, followed by '.' (.), followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of a, followed by the letter 'E' (E), followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer, as produced by the method of one argument. How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a? There must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type float. That is, suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument f. Then f must be the float value nearest to x; or, if two float values are equally close to xthen f must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of f must be 0.

 Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If the length of b is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b. The first byte read is stored into element b[0], the next one into b[1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to the length of b. Let k be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements b[0] through b[k-1], leaving elements b[k] through b[b.length-1] unaffected. If the first byte cannot be read for any reason other than end of file, then an IOException is thrown. In particular, an IOException is thrown if the input stream has been closed. The read(b) method for class InputStream has the same effect as: read(b, 0, b.length)

If matched then "jump" to that node, otherwise ignore the tag. Note, the list of // expressions found while walking back up the tree is chached in the HashMap decends. Then if the new tag is to be skipped, any inner chil tags are compared against the cache and jumped to if matched.

 This method deals with the fact, that the decoding process doesn't always yield a single most likely value. The current error correction implementation doesn't deal with erasures very well, so it's better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure. The problem is that we don't know which of the ambiguous values to choose. We try decode using the first value, and if that fails, we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again. This usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes, so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this.

 Inserts the string into this string buffer. The characters of the String argument are inserted, in order, into this string buffer at the indicated offset, moving up any characters originally above that position and increasing the length of this string buffer by the length of the argument. If str is null, then the four characters "null" are inserted into this string buffer. The character at index k in the new character sequence is equal to: the character at index k in the old character sequence, if k is less than offset the character at index k-offset in the argument str, if k is not less than offset but is less than offset+str.length() the character at index k-str.length() in the old character sequence, if k is not less than offset+str.length() The offset argument must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to the length of this string buffer.

 Flushes page and it's content stream. <br> <br> If the page belongs to the document which is tagged, page flushing also triggers flushing of the tags, which are considered to belong to the page. The logic that defines if the given tag (structure element) belongs to the page is the following: if all the marked content references (dictionary or number references), that are the descenders of the given structure element, belong to the current page - the tag is considered to belong to the page. If tag has descenders from several pages - it is flushed, if all other pages except the current one are flushed.

 Converts a database name to a Java variable name. The naming conventions used to allow for this are as follows: a database name (table or column) is in all capital letters, and the words are separated by an underscore (for example: NEAT_ENTITY_NAME or RANDOM_FIELD_NAME); a Java name (ejb or field) is in all lower case letters, except the letter at the beginning of each word (for example: NeatEntityName or RandomFieldName). The convention of using a capital letter at the beginning of a class name in Java, or a lower-case letter for the beginning of a variable name in Java is also used along with the Java name convention above.
 The byte[] returned by MessageDigest does not have a nice textual representation, so some form of encoding is usually performed.

 Morph is similar to the replace functionality where a component might be replaced with  a component that isn't within the container. However, unlike the replace functionality which uses a transition and assumes the position of the component (and is hence quite flexible) morph can move and resize the component. E.g. after entering text into a text field and pressing submit it can "morph" into a chat bubble located in a different part of the screen.<br> It is the responsibility of the caller to remove the source component (if desired) and revalidate the  container when the animation completes.

 ALGORITHM AS R94 APPL. STATIST. (1995) VOL.44, NO.4 <p> Calculates Shapiro-Wilk normality test and P-value for sample sizes 3 <= n <= 5000 . Handles censored or uncensored data. Corrects AS 181, which was found to be inaccurate for n > 50. <p> NOTE: Semi-strange porting kludge alert. FORTRAN allows subroutine arguments to be modified by the called routine (passed by reference, not value), and the original code for this routine makes use of that feature to return multiple results. To avoid changing the code any more than necessary, I've used Java arrays to simulate this pass-by-reference feature. Specifically, in the original code w, pw, and ifault are output results, not input parameters. Pass in double[1] arrays for w and pw, and extract the computed values from the [0] element on return. The argument init is both input and output; use a boolean[1] array and initialize [0] to false before the first call. The routine will update the value to true to record that initialization has been performed, to speed up subsequent calls on the same data set. Note that although the contents of a[] will be computed by the routine on the first call, the caller must still allocate the array space and pass the unfilled array in to the subroutine. The routine will set the contents but not allocate the space. <p> As described above with the constants, the data arrays x[] and a[] are referenced with a base element of 1 (like FORTRAN) instead of 0 (like Java) to avoid screwing up the algorithm. To pass in 100 data points, declare x[101] and fill elements x[1] through x[100] with data. x[0] will be ignored.

 There are two reasons why we don't use buffer per window when Vista's DWM (aka Aero) is enabled: - since with DWM all windows are already double-buffered, the application doesn't get expose events so we don't get to use our true back-buffer, wasting memory and performance (this is valid for both d3d and gdi pipelines) - in some cases with buffer per window enabled it is possible for the paint manager to redirect rendering to the screen for some operations (like copyArea), and since bpw uses its own BufferStrategy the d3d onscreen rendering support is disabled and rendering goes through GDI. This doesn't work well with Vista's DWM since one can not perform GDI and D3D operations on the same surface (see 6630702 for more info) Note: even though DWM composition state can change during the lifetime of the application it is a rare event, and it is more often that it is temporarily disabled (because of some app) than it is getting permanently enabled so we can live with this approach without the complexity of dwm state listeners and such. This can be revisited if proved otherwise.
 Return the area of triangle ABC. The method used is about twice as expensive as Girard's formula, but it is numerically stable for both large and very small triangles.

 This method determines which menu items get to be 'action items' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be 'overflow items' in a secondary menu. The rules are as follows: <p>Items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu. There is a limit of mMaxActionItems as a total count, optionally including the overflow menu button itself. This is a soft limit; if an item shares a group ID with an item previously included as an action item, the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit. This is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar. Only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space, and groups are treated as a single concept. <p>There is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space: mActionWidthLimit. This limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space, but no further items may be added. If an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width, the entire group will be demoted to overflow. This is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general UI clutter. <p>The space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items. Once items begin to overflow, all future items become overflow items as well. This is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app's intended design.

 Summary. For any syntax error thrown by the parser, there will be an ErrorNode in the parse tree and this method will process it. All errors correspond to actual tokens in the input except for missing token errors. There are there are multiple error situations to consider: 1. Extraneous token. The parse tree will have an ErrorNode for token. 2. Token mismatch. The parse tree will have an ErrorNode for token. 3. Missing token. The parse tree will have an ErrorNode but it does not correspond to any bit of the input. We underline the current token. 4. NoViableAlt (input inconsistent with any rule alt). The parse tree will have an ErrorNode for token. 5. Tokens consumed to resync the parser during recovery. The parse tree will have an ErrorNode for each token. This is complicated by errors that occur at EOF but I have modified error strategy to add error nodes for EOF if needed. Another complication. During prediction, we might match n tokens and then fail on the n+1 token, leading to NoViableAltException. But, it's offending token is at n+1 not current token where prediction started (which we use to find syntax errors). So, SyntaxError objects return start not offending token in this case.

 This class can find composite routes between two territories. Example set of matches: [Friendly Land, score: 1] [Enemy Land, score: 2] [Neutral Land, score = 4] With this example set, an 8 length friendly route is considered equal in score to a 4 length enemy route and a 2 length neutral route. This is because the friendly route score is 1/2 of the enemy route score and 1/4 of the neutral route score. Note that you can choose whatever scores you want, and that the matches can mix and match with each other in any way.

 Sorts the passed list of full copy source objects based on the natural sort order of their labels. Used to align the labels for the full copies with their sources. For example say you have a CG with two volumes foo-1 and foo-2, and you then create a full copy of one of these volumes. Because they are in a CG, a full copy is created for each volume in the CG. When we create the full copies with a name of bar, then we want the full copy for foo-1 to be bar-1, and the full copy for foo-2 to be bar-2. However, when you get the volumes in the CG, there is no guarantee of order. Now there is no restriction that volumes in a CG are named like this, but often they are because often one would create multiple volumes in a CG in a single request. So, in this simple case, then the full copy names should align. We can always create a more sophisticated comparator for the sort routine if something more elaborate is desired.

 This is an important usability feature to have in our CPP transformation. Asking the user to add "depend" statement for their code in each used parameter is some extra work. However, it is not that much, but the issue that in a language when the user forgets about adding the required depend, they can find a massive number of errors in the generated code due to that missing depends, and finding out that the missing depends is the reason can  take sometime. In a language such as Java, this is not a problem to realize that missing depend, but in CPP it can be even a nightmare in many cases.

 writeMetaBits must be called after all allocations have been made, the last one being the allocation for the metabits themselves (allowing for an extension!). Ticket #936: The meta-bits allocation is currently made from the FixedAllocator region. This works well providing the required allocation bits is less than the maximum FixedAllocator slot size.  While this is neat, there are problems at scale for maximum slot sizes less than 64K. To address the 8K bits in a 1K alloctor, 13 bits are required, this leaves 19 bits to index an Allocator, or 18 bits without the sign => 256K maximum index. To be able to commit changes to all 256K allocators requires 512K metabits => 64K bytes. We would like to associate the 64K allocations with the root block, so a single 128K allocation would be split into 64K demi-spaces, one for each root block. While a negative address indicates a standard RW allocation a ositive address can be used to indicate an explicitly allocated region. The trick is to ensure that the region is allocated on a 128K boundary, then the lower bits can indicate which demi-space is used with a simple XOR. Note that we must ensure that any previous demi-space write is removed from the WCS.
